# Kuhraiy Chronicles: Ryuma

WIP concept game design I'm working on in Lex Talionis. Kuhraiy Chronicles is a tentative name for my original series, this concept is just an idea I had designing an FE-style game set in this original series/universe.

I have gone ahead and outlined all credits of the assets currently being used. I don't know if/when I will finish this project, but I am working on it.
