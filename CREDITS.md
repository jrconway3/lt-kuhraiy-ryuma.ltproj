# Kuhraiy Chronicles: Ryuma Credits

Worldbuilding, Scenario Writing, Dialogue, and Characters by JaidynReiman

Map Designs, Event Coding, Game Mechanics by JaidynReiman


## Game Engine

Lex Talionis Engine and LT-Maker Editor created by rainlash

With additional programming and help from the Lex Talionis Discord server, including mag, KD, Sigmaraven, TheeBill, Lord Tweed, ZessDynamite, Nemid, Kyogokudo, beccarte, Meinerieve, Greentwip, Klokinator, Sealvester, Joytis, and aorlnn.

Narrow fonts and droppable item icon originally created by Scraiza.

Lex Talionis is a non-profit engine, released for free, and developed using Python, Pygame, and PyQt5. Some default assets are copyrighted or trademarked by their respective owners.

Licensed under the MIT License.


## Assets

All assets used were either modifications by me or imported from the FE Graphics and Music Repositories:
https://github.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo

Special Thanks to Klokinator (as well as Jj09 and Jey the Count) for gathering all these resources.

The grand majority were from the repo, but I did make some modifications. I will be listing off all assets here, but if I forgot any, please let me know! I'm trying to make sure I have _everything_ before I release anything, but if I did miss something, let me know right away.

Many assets used at this time (ESPECIALLY portraits) are merely placeholders. Eventually I would like more original assets for portraits and for specific characters, but it takes time to make customizations.


This is a comprehensive credits list of all assets currently imported into the project. This is not necessarily stuff I will use in the end, but it is stuff I have imported and exists in this repository. Eventually I will clear out the contents of stuff I end up not using.

Only stuff actively being used in the game will be added to the in-game credits.


### Icons

Since switching to Lex Talionis, I have not yet fully imported all icons. LT icons are in sheets and I'm trying to set up solid configuration for these sheets. I am attempting to use pre-configured sheets where possible, otherwise I'm compiling full sheets for different artists so I can easily credit just one artist for all their assets. However, I'm also trying to keep my icons relatively similar.

#### Item Icons
Diamond (Gem 6 - Maxim)
Emerald (Gem 2 - Maxim)
Sapphire (Gem 5 - Maxim)
Ruby (Gem 4 - Maxim)
Garnet (Icon 134 - Zelix)
Opal (Icon 152 - Zelix)

##### Stat Icons
Siylphe Wing / Replaces Angelic Robe (Herbs by Beansy)
Lykon Claw / Replaces Energy Ring (FE15 Item 26 by Cardcafe)

##### Promotion (License) Icons
All licenses currently use GBA Master Seal until further notice.

These are possibilities I considered but ultimately cut, but could be considered later:
Pirate's Proof / Replaces Ocean Seal (Item 35 by Zarg) NOTE: this has been cut
Kitezh Crest / Replaces Lunar Brace (Sylvain Scale by Beansy) NOTE: this has been cut
Nordak Crest / Replaces Solar Brace (SacredWar Item 33 by Seal) NOTE: this has been cut


#### Skill Icons
Complete LT Skill Icons by ZessDynamite, Rainlash, LordGleen, and Suneohair
+/- 7 and 10 to all stats added by JaidynReiman

I will try and reflect FE's normal icon styles if possible but if I'm not using something from FE, I may repurpose an icon that fits well.


#### Affinity Icons

### World Map

The World Map was designed by me. I originally had some rough ideas in my head for what I needed in specific locations.

1. I generated a bunch of fantasy world maps using [Donjon Fantasy World Generator](http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/) and found the one that best fit the idea I had in my head.
2. From there, I outlined the map's borders using a program I found online called AutoREALM, [available via SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autorealm/).
3. This was my final World Map for years until I discovered [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/).
4. Using Inkarnate I made the final version of my map, using the original map design to mask out the continents as close as possible to my original design (https://inkarnate.com/m/P7eyDW), however its not fully fleshed out in detail.
5. Then I (converted it to a Parchment style)[https://inkarnate.com/m/Gzx2dK] to simplify the colors to make it easier to reduce colors and import into a romhack (which I abandoned).
5. Finally, I used tools to crop out the northern continents and added cities and other notable landmarks. [This is the version of the map I intend on using in the game.](https://inkarnate.com/m/mNbJE8)

### Maps

#### Tilesets

##### Tilesets I Used
Village - Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras (by flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno)
FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields (by WAve, RandomWizard, Beast; Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains by Dark, inspired by LeifOClaude; Autumn/Marsh/Verdant by Zarg)
Cynon's Metropolis by Cynon
FE8 Castle + Customs - Tileset Improved by N426
Desert Bastion Village by Gamma, ZoramineFae, Venno, N426

##### Autotiles
Custom tilesets cannot easily be imported into LT in all cases. Many custom tilesets change up the animations, and as such, need new autotiles to generate new animations for tilemaps.

- Cynon's Metropolis
    - Autotiles by JaidynReiman
    - Edited from Cynon's GBA Map Animations
- FE6 Fields - SnowyRemake Autotiles
    - Autotiles by JaidynReiman
    - Requested by Silvio
    - Edited from SnowyRemake's GBA Map Animations by N426
- Village Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras
    - Autotiles by JaidynReiman
    - Edited from Village Remake's GBA Map Animations by flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno

#### Map Design

##### Maps
AuraWolf's Snap a Crap Pack V3.1 maps in general have been very useful starting points to get the feel of how maps should look, and how certain tile placements should work. The ship tiles especially are quite complicated. All of the following maps of AuraWolf I used either as starting points/inspiration for map chapter designs, or heavily modified to map the final map:
Aura Wolf's FE8 Overworld 28
Aura Wolf's Town A and Town 3E
Aura Wolf's Ship 1E/Ship 2

Chapter 7 (Aura Wolf's FE8 Overworld 28 used as initial inspiration, final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter 8 (inspired by "field view" of Prologue maps)
Chapter 9 (Aura Wolf's ?? used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter 10 (Aura Wolf's Town A and Town 3E used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter 11 (Aura Wolf's Ship 1E/Ship 2 used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)

Chapter XX Haunted by Tragedy (inspired by Aura Wolf's Ship 2)


### Backgrounds

#### Event Backgrounds
Lunar PSP Backgrounds by Fenreir

#### Battle Platforms
Metropolis Platforms (Dark Cobblestone by Cynon)

#### Battle Backgrounds

#### Battle Grounds


### Music

Music credits are structured as such:

My intended use of the song (franchise or game name, name of the song - artist who made the song in FEGBA style)

For the original creators of the song in question, check the credits of that game. I have attempted to include some that I am aware of but its difficult to look up the exact artist in every scenario.

In-game I attempted to use the actual full song name (franchise name, song name, and credits) but it doesn't fit in the game, so I have simply included the original song name and the credits to make things easier.

Most music is from the FE Music Repo. However, because LT supports OGG and other formats, I will also be mixing in some open game music as well. This can include music from www.opengameart.org or www.soundimage.org.
