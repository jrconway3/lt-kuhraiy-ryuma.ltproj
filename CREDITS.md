# Kuhraiy Chronicles: Ryuma Credits

Comprehensive credits list of all assets currently imported into the project. This is not necessarily stuff I will use in the end, but it is stuff I have imported and exists in this repository. Eventually I will clear out the contents of stuff I end up not using.


## Assets

All assets used were either modifications by me or imported from the FE Graphics and Music Repositories:
https://github.com/Klokinator/FE-Repo

Special Thanks to Klokinator for gathering all these resources.

The grand majority were from the repo, but I did make some modifications. I will be listing off all assets here, but if I forgot any, please let me know! I'm trying to make sure I have _everything_ before I release anything, but if I did miss something, let me know right away.

Many assets used at this time (ESPECIALLY portraits) are merely placeholders. Eventually I would like more original assets for portraits and for specific characters, but it takes time to make customizations.

##### Civilians
I designed variant civilian assets for my major races, but these are just modified from the base civilian assets by IS.
"Eofol" is the term used for the closest equivalent I have to humans, but they're not very common.
"Alf" for all intents and purposes look like ordinary elves. There's technically a difference but its easier to just label them as "elf" in the asset name.
"Lykon" are Alphar who have wolf-like attributes. Their ears are curved a bit, long, and furry, intended to be somewhat like canines.
"Zabos" are Alphar who have cat-like attributes. Their ears are closer to elves, but triangular shape and furred.
"Queiza" are Alphar who are aquatic-based. My versions of mermaids, but they have both legs and fin tails.
"Chiylo" effectively look just like humans with short pointed ears and horns. Could be argued to be sort of goblin-like. They have tails, but they usually only bring out their tails when needed, so they don't have them in most frames.

Eofol (Civilian Man, Woman, Child, Girl by IS)
Alf (Elven Man, Woman, Child, Girl by JaidynReiman)

##### Nobles
Eventually I may add custom noble variants for my races. For now these are placeholders, but I won't ever have "nobles" that are Eofol.

### World Map

World Map Image -
Original rough draft idea by me (JaidynReiman)
Initial map generated using Donjon Fantasy World Generator (http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/world/)
Final Map Outline Created By Me Using AutoREALM (https://sourceforge.net/projects/autorealm/)
Map Redrawn From the AutoREALM Map Using Inkarnate (https://inkarnate.com/)
Inkarnate Filters Used to Create the "Parchment" Design (to simplify colors)
Map converted to 15 colors and resized in GIMP (https://www.gimp.org/)

I tried to generate regional overlays, but ultimately scrapped that idea as my regions were to large. To keep the map clean, I cropped it down as much as possible so it only focuses on the area explorable in the game. This allows the map to have better spaced nodes. Thankfully, Inkarnate can easily cut out a region of the map and enlarge that portion, though it also results in some of the "fine details" becoming more noticeable, so I ironed out as many flaws as I could. That said, the final map design still isn't perfect, but its decent enough.

### Maps

#### Tilesets

##### Guides That Helped Me Import Custom Tilesets
DerTheVaporeon for his excellent guide (https://feuniverse.us/t/fe8-tileset-insertion-editing-tutorial-derthevaporeon-2018/4102)
XPGamesNL for his video guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6el531ZXMl4)

##### Tilesets I Used
Village - Vanilla FE8 (I replaced these with Village - Remake, but the early new map designs used this map)
Village - Remake + Coconut Tree + Ship Extras (by flasuban, N426, ZoramineFae, Venno)
FE8 - Fields - Remaster - Super Fields (by WAve, RandomWizard, Beast; Aquamarine Roofs + Gray Mountains by Dark, inspired by LeifOClaude; Autumn/Marsh/Verdant by Zarg)
Cynon's Metropolis by Cynon

##### Autotiles
Custom tilesets cannot easily be imported into LT in all cases. Many custom tilesets change up the animations, and as such, need new autotiles to generate new animations for tilemaps.

#### Map Design

##### Maps
AuraWolf's Snap a Crap Pack V3.1 maps in general have been very useful starting points to get the feel of how maps should look, and how certain tile placements should work. The ship tiles especially are quite complicated. All of the following maps of AuraWolf I used either as starting points/inspiration for map chapter designs, or heavily modified to map the final map:
Aura Wolf's FE8 Overworld 28
Aura Wolf's Town A and Town 3E
Aura Wolf's Ship 1E/Ship 2

Prologue (Aura Wolf's FE8 Overworld 28 used as initial inspiration, final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Prologue-Scene / Dorma Village (map designed as extension of Prologue map to the north)
Chapter 1 (inspired by "field view" of Prologue maps)
Chapter 2 (Aura Wolf's ?? used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter 3 (Aura Wolf's Town A and Town 3E used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter 4 (Aura Wolf's Ship 1E/Ship 2 used as inspiration; final map completely designed by me, JaidynReiman)
Chapter

Chapter 14 Haunted by Tragedy (the original Prologue map; base design is Aura Wolf's Ship 2 but it was updated by me, JaidynReiman, with tile changes, but still is heavily inspired by it)
Chapter 14-Scene / Miriam's Room in Oestridel Manor ()



### Music

Music credits are structured as such:

My intended use of the song (franchise or game name, name of the song - artist who made the song in FEGBA style)

For the original creators of the song in question, check the credits of that game. I have attempted to include some that I am aware of but its difficult to look up the exact artist in every scenario.

In-game I attempted to use the actual full song name (franchise name, song name, and credits) but it doesn't fit in the game, so I have simply included the original song name and the credits to make things easier.
