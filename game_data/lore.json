That is how they make their way in this world.\n\nSister Kasuto... how could you? You were... a spy... all along?! Your entire family are of these... Kuhraiy... including that of dear Relm?\n\nI see... so that's what Nordak are. Now it makes sense. Nordak must be... the ancient form of the Kuhraiy! Most of them seem to be degraded now. Might Kasuto also be..."

In truth, the Kuhraiy were merely their spy network. However, when the ancient Nordak were wiped out, all that remained were the spy network.\n\nNo one in the world accepted them, so they became but a shadow. In turn, becoming as a shadow, most of them degraded. Kasuto and Relm were the first true Nordak born to them in a milennia.\n\nThey used the name Kuhraiy to spread fear of their influence on purpose, but with their many branches, were able to limit the amount of knowledge of them. However, not entirely without fault.\n\nThey settled in these mountains of Masa before even the Kingdom itself did. The scattered tribes lived around the mountains, but not within them, until they were driven to the mountains and eventually, pushed the Kuhraiy out.\n\n'tis a tragic tale, one that shan't end here, either. After all, I too shall suffer from the same fate."
